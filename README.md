3) Drag the apk file onto the screen of the device. 
4) It should automatically install. The app should start once the apk is installed.
5) If the app doesn't automatically start, search in the Google bar for Goldfish.
6) An Android icon app with the name GoldFish should appear. Click on it to start the app.

### How to Open Android Emulator
